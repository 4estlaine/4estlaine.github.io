I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley, advised by Professor Claire Tomlin. My research is on the design of numerical methods for the safe and effective deployment of autonomous systems. I focus predominantly on theoretic and algorithmic developments of methods related to dynamic game theory, and the application of such methods to robotic systems. Problems I am particularly interested in are those of mult-agent interaction, multiple-object tracking, and robust machine learning. 

I have worked on several production-grade autonomous systems, at Ike Robotics, Boeing, Uber ATG, and Apple SPG. These experiences have grounded my research to challenges faced by actual advanced robotic platforms.  

I am originally from Bellingham, Washington. When I'm not doing research, I love to hike, surf, rock climb, ski, and play chess.
