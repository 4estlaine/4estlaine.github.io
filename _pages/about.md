This is my home on the web! I am a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley, advised by Professor Claire Tomlin. My research is on the design of numerical methods for the safe and effective deployment of autonomous systems. I focus predominantly on the application of game theory to robotic systems, for solving tasks such as mult-agent interaction and trajectory optimization of hybrid systems. 

I am originally from Bellingham, Washington. When I'm not doing research, I love to hike, surf, rock climb, ski, and play chess.
