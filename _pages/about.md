Update: I have accepted an offer to join as an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Vanderbilt University starting Fall 2021. If you are a student interested in doing a Ph.D. on numerical optimization and game theory applied to robotics problems, email me!

I am currently a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley, advised by Professor Claire Tomlin. My research is on the design of numerical methods for the safe and effective deployment of autonomous systems. I focus predominantly on theoretic and algorithmic developments of methods related to dynamic game theory, and the application of such methods to robotic systems. Problems I am particularly interested in are those of mult-agent interaction, multiple-object tracking, trajectory optimization, and robust machine learning.

I am originally from Bellingham, Washington. When I'm not doing research, I love to spend time outside.
