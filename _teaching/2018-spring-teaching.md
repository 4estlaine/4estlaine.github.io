Served as head TA for advanced graduate course titled "Hybrid Systems, Computation and Control". As part of this course, I designed and gave lectures for a 3-week submodule of the course on optimal control and trajectory optimization. I was awarded the UC Berkeley Outsanding Graduate Student Instructor award for excellence in teaching during this course.
